        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level programmiing language widely known for its vast range of libaries and versitility. It's popular because it's easy to learn, has a vast ecosystem of libraries - for web development, data science, AI, etc., a strong community, and is cross-platform compatible, enabling rapid development across many applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is the program that reads and executes the Python code. It processes the code line by line, translating it into instructions the computer can understand and running them directly, without needing a separate compilation step for the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and functionalities within the language. You cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, classes, or any other identifiers because they are already used by Python itself to define its syntax and structure.\n",
        "  Example: print, if, else, while, and, or, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - No, keywords in python cannot be used as variable names. Each keyword like if, else, or, etc., has a pre-defined meaning and performs a specific function for the Python interpreter. Using them as variable names would make the interpreter unable to distinguish whether you want to define a variable or use the keyword's special functionality. This would lead to a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutable objects/ containers/ data structures are those whose state or value can be changed after they are created. List is an example of mutable object. This is also called item assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because they are designed to be dynamic collections where elements can be added, removed, or changed in-place after the list is created. This makes them flexible for data that needs to be modified.\n",
        "  Tuples are immutable because they are designed to be fixed collections. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This provides data integrity (not letting data get altered accidentally).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In python, \"==\" is a comparason operator while \"is\" is an identity operator.   \n",
        "\n",
        "  Equality (\"==\") oprator is used to check value equality. It determines the contents or values of the objects are same or not irrespective of their memory locations.\n",
        "  Example: [1,2,3] == [1,2,3]  \n",
        "  #this would return \"True\" as both the containers are equal in values even if stored at differnt memory locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Identity (\"is\") operator is used to check object identity. It determines if the variables refers to the same object in the memory.\n",
        "  Example: a = 5    b = 5    a is b    \n",
        "  #this will return \"True\" as both a nd b refer to the same object in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements (expressions that evaluate to True or False) and return a Boolean result (True or False). They are:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  AND: Returns True if both operands are True.\n",
        "  OR: Returns True if at least one operand is True.\n",
        "  NOT: Reverses the Boolean value of an operand (turns True to False and False to True).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Type casting (also known as type conversion) in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is useful when you need to perform operations that require specific data types, or when you receive data in one format and need to use it in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Implicit Type Casting (Coercion): Python's interpreter automatically converts one data type to another, usually to prevent data loss or errors in operations involving mixed types.\n",
        "  Example: an integer added to a float results in a float.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion): The programmer manually converts a data type using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. This gives you direct control over the conversion, even if it means potential data loss.\n",
        "  Example: converting a float to an integer truncates decimals.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Conditional statements in Python like if, elif, and else, allow your program to make decisions. They execute different blocks of code based on whether specific conditions are true or false, enabling dynamic behavior and controlled program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The elif statement in Python, short for \"else if,\" works by allowing you to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if statement.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Working:\n",
        "\n",
        "  First the initial \"if\" statement is checked. If the condition is TRUE the code block associated with the \"if\" statement is executed and the remaining if-elif-else block is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If the initial \"if\" statement is FALSE the program moves on to the first \"elif\" code block.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If the \"elif\" condition is TRUE the code block is executed and the program comes out if the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If the \"elif\" condition is FALSE the program proceeds to the next 'elif\" statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This process repeats itself until the next \"elif\" condition evaluates to TRUE and the corresponding code block is executed, skipping the remaining \"elif\" statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If none of the \"IF\" or \"elif\" conditions evaluates to TRUE then an optional \"else\" condition is executed and the program falls out of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For and while lopps both are used to iterate over the items but their working is differnt from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For loop is used when the user knows the number of iteration required. The iterations will occur only for the specified number of times. These are also used to iterate over the items in a list, tuple, string, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "  While loop is used when the user does not know the number of iterations required. The program will continue in a loop until the given condition evaluates to FALSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Imagine you're building a simple \"Guess the Number\" game. The game needs to continue running, allowing the player to make guesses, until they guess the correct number.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why while loop is more suitable than a for loop here - You don't know in advance how many guesses it will take the player to hit the right number. The loop's continuation is entirely dependent on the condition that the player's guess is not equal to the secret number. This \"continue as long as a condition is true\" is the perfect fit for a while loop. A for loop, which typically iterates a fixed number of times or over a collection, wouldn't naturally model this indefinite repetition.\n",
